      <br>Release Notes
      <br>Specify 6.7.00
      <br>13 April 2018
      <br></strong><br>
    <p>

      <li>Specify 6.7 adds Batch Editing, a powerful new capability for bulk changes to Specify core data tables.  Batch Editing will be particularly useful for improving data quality by correcting inconsistencies and by batch filling empty data fields.  The editing process begins with a query on one of five base tables: Agent, Collecting Event, Collection Object, Locality, or Preparation.  There is embedded context sensitive help and a Batch Editing video tutorial on the Specify Collection Consortium web site.<br>
        <p>
          Batch Editing is capable of changing thousands of records with a few mouse clicks. It is important to have a basic understanding of core Specify data table relationships before using it. Once changes are reviewed and applied, they become permanent. Specify does not save a copy of original data that has been changed. With the power to alter large numbers of records easily, a small, inadvertent editing mistake could have unexpected consequences and make a large number of your Specify records incorrect and unusable. A very smart risk avoidance strategy would be to create a fresh backup copy of your database before Batch Editing, in case the backup copy is needed to restore your database.</p></li>

      <li> We are pleased to display on the Specify splash screen, the logos of the initial Founding Partners of the Specify Collection Consortium: the University of Florida, University of Michigan, and University of Kansas. If you would like to see your institution among these collections leaders, tell us how we can help.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Specify can now export Query Results to xls-format (Excel) files for data sets containing tens of thousands of records.</li><br>
      <li>We added the fields GeoRefCompiledBy and GeoRefCompileddate to the GeoCoordDetail table and made them accessible through the WorkBench and Batch Editing.</li><br>
      <li>When using GeoLocate, the WorkBench now fills the MaxUncertaintyEstUnit by default with “m”.</li><br>
      <li>MaxUncertaintyEst values now import correctly into the WorkBench from external files.</li><br>
      <li>If a Preparation record is cloned, the value of the Preparation GUID field is not. A bug in earlier Specify versions duplicated GUIDs in cloned Preparation records.  This update includes logic to assign a new GUID to any existing preparation records that hold duplicate GUIDs.</li><br>
      <li>We added the ability to process loans for Collection Objects that are not cataloged in the same loan with cataloged objects.</li>
