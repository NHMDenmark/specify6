      11 July 2019 <br>
      </strong><br>
    
	<u>General Note</u>
  <p>This small Specify 6 maintenance release addresses three recent issues of some urgency. It does not update the Specify database schema. Another Specify 6 release with additional fixes and a likely schema update will be released in August 2019.</p>
	<u>Issues resolved</u>
    <ol>
      <li>Batch Editing Locality records from a Collection Object query that does not include a field from the Collecting Event table will no longer result in the Station Field Number data for that record being deleted. (GitHub Issue 300)
      <li>Zero Date setting in MySQL is no longer included in the Data Exporter Database connection.  The Data Exporter will no longer throw an error when partial dates include a "00" value for a portion of the date for any collections. (301)</li>
      <li> Resolved connectivity/permission problem with basemap Open Street Map layer used in the GeoLocate Plugin. (310) </li>
    </ol>
