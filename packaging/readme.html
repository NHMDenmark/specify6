      <br>Release Notes
      <br>Specify 6.7.00
      <br>14 March 2018

      <li>Specify 6.7 adds an often requested capability, Batch Editing.  The new module enables bulk changes to key data tables.  Batch Editing will be particularly useful for improving data quality by correcting inconsistencies and by bulk filling empty data fields.  The editing process begins with a query on one of five base tables: Agent, Collecting Event, Collection Object, Locality, or Preparation.  There is new context sensitive help for Batch Editing and an introductory video tutorial will soon be viewable from the Specify Collections Consortium web site.<br>
        <p>
          Batch Editing is a powerful and sometimes nuanced feature, capable of changing thousands of records with a few mouse clicks. It is good to have a basic understanding of the core Specify data table relationships before using the new module.  Once changes are applied, they are permanent.  With such data changing power, a small, inadvertent editing mistake might permanently make your data massively incorrect and unusable. It is very smart to have a fresh backup copy of your database before applying massive changes, in case a backup copy needs to be restored.</p></li>

      <li> We are pleased to display on our splash screens, the logos of the first three Founding Member Institutions of the Specify Collections Consortium: University of Florida, University of Michigan, and the University of Kansas.  If you would like to see your institution among those of these collections leaders, let us know.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Specify can now export Query Results to xls-format (Excel) files for data sets containing tens of thousands of records.</li><br>
      <li>Added the fields GeoRefCompiledBy and GeoRefCompileddate to the GeoCoordDetail table and made the fields accessible through the WorkBench and Batch Editing.</li><br>
      <li>When using GeoLocate, the WorkBench now fills the MaxUncertaintyEstUnit by default with “m”.</li><br>
      <li>MaxUncertaintyEst values import correctly into the WorkBench from external files.</li><br>
      <li>If a Preparation record is cloned, the value of the Preparation GUID field is not. A bug in earlier Specify versions duplicated GUIDs in cloned Preparation records.  This release includes a script to assign a new GUID to any existing preparation records that hold duplicate GUIDs.</li>
