    </h2>
    <p>
       NEW in the 6.7 release of the Specify desktop application, we offer the ability to edit a
      'batch' of data using an interface very similar to the WorkBench. Batch Editing is a powerful
      method to improve data quality -- it can potentially change thousands of data records with
      just a few mouse clicks. Once edits are made and confirmed, changes will be permanent and
      they cannot be rolled back. We recommend you take the following precautions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a backup of your data before using the Batch Editor
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that you understand the relationships represented by the fields and tables you wish
        to change before using the Batch Editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        When creating queries to choose the data that will be displayed in the Batch Editor, create
        the query from the primary table, and&nbsp;include fields and tables related to the
        specific data you wish to edit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a batch edit has been completed, it is a good idea to view updated results of your
        query to confirm that the changes made to the data did not have unintended consequences in
        related fields and tables.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is best, when possible, not to edit multiple fields from multiple tables during a single
        Batch Editing session, but to limit the edits to fields in a single table.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       A few other notes regarding the Batch Editor:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a limit of 7000 records that can be edited at one time. If you wish to edit more
        data you will need to split your data into batches of 7000 and edit each batch
        individually. It may be useful to first split your data into saved Record Sets prior to
        starting the batch edit process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Batch editing is only available to users with the <em>Admin</em> or <em>Manager</em> status
        who also have access to both the Query Builder and WorkBench tools. If you wish to enable
        batch editing for a <em>Full Access</em> user please contact the Specify team.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this time Taxonomy, Stratigraphy and Lithostratigraph&nbsp;information can only be
        viewed, and not edited&nbsp;in the Batch Editor tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fields that are read only in the schema, unique identifiers (such as GUID or Catalog
        Number), formatted or aggregated can only be viewed, and not edited&nbsp;in the Batch
        Editor tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        When deleting values in geography and locality tree fields only fields without child data
        can be deleted, one can delete children in tree fields as long as there are no child
        records.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you bring data into the Batch Editor, you are essentially 'checking it out' from the
        database so that you may make changes that will later be validated and applied. If other
        users are also accessing and editing the same data, this can result in&nbsp;a different
        version of data in the database when your Batch Editing session is attempting to validate
        them. In this instance Specify will not commit the change and will alert you to this action
        in a status dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
        When more than one collection resides in a single database some tables are shared;
        therefore, changes in any of the shared tables will affect other collections.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The following documentation for the Batch Editor is meant only as a basic overview. To
      better explain the changes that will be made to related data when using the Batch Editing
      tool we have created a video which demonstrates these changes using real workflows. That
      video can be found on our website:&nbsp;&lt;a
      href="http://www.sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts/"&gt;sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts&lt;/a&gt;

    </p>
    <p>
       Open the Batch Editing tool by clicking the <img alt="batch edit" src=
      "../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">&nbsp;(Batch Edit) button on the Task Bar (at the top of
      the Specify screen).
    </p>

    <p>
       To use the Batch Editor you must first choose the records you wish to edit. The side bar
      offers helpful options to get started:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a new query by clicking the appropriate table in the <em>Create Query</em> section
        of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         The <em>Create Query</em> section of the side bar lists the tables that are available to
        batch edit.
      </p>
      <p>
         Start by clicking the table that contains the data you wish to edit.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open a saved query by clicking the appropriate query in the <em>Saved Queries</em> section
        of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         If there is&nbsp;an existing query that will include the data you wish to batch edit
        choose it from the side bar.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose a record set in the <em>Record Set</em> section of the side bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         If there is a&nbsp;saved Record Set that you wish to batch edit from the query used to
        create it, or another saved query, right-mouse click on the record set and choose <em>View
        with Saved Query</em> from the pop-up dialog.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When doing Batch Edits from a&nbsp;Collection Object query,
      Specify basically 'flattens' the data when bringing it into the batch editor. Therefore,
      changes made to fields in the batch editor will only affect that single Collection Object
      record. However, when creating queries from one of the other tables, the changes made will be
      reflected in all related records. The Batch Editing video explains this in more detail: &lt;a
      href="http://www.sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts/"&gt;sustain.specifysoftware.org/support/helpcasts&lt;/a&gt;

    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       If you chose to create a query or open a saved query, you will notice that the Query Builder
      interface is displayed. Choose the tables and fields you wish to edit. Also, include related
      data that will allow you to determine the uniqueness of the records you are editing. For help
      using the Query Builder please <a href="Query_Builder.html">Click Here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have completed your query you may wish to save it by clicking the <em>Save</em>
      button at the bottom of the Workspace and naming your query. This is useful when editing
      large sets of data that require multiple Batch Editing instances.
    </p>
    <p>
       Otherwise, click the <em>Search</em> button at the bottom of the Workspace to display your
      query results. The data you see in the query results screen is the exact data that will be
      displayed in the Batch Editor.

    <p>
       Once you are satisfied that you have successfully chosen the data you wish to edit you can
      either bring all the data or a subset of the data into the Batch Editor.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the <img alt="batch edit" src="../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">(Batch Edit) button
        located at the top-right corner of the Search Results bar&nbsp;to display all the data into
        the Batch Editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limit the data by either clicking each record while holding down the <em>Ctrl</em> key, or
        clicking on a record and dragging your mouse to select multiple records. Then, click the
        <img src="../images/batch_editing_24x24.png">&nbsp;(Batch Edit) button located at the
        top-right corner of the Search Results bar.

       Your data is now available to manipulate in the Batch Editor tool. The Batch Editor
      interface is similar to the WorkBench, with the same features for manipulating data, such as;
      copy, past, sort, fill up, fill down, etc. For more information about the tools available
      please <a href="../Workbench/GridEditing.html">Click Here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When deleting terms in the batch editor ensure that there
      are no spaces in the field.

    </p>
    <p>
       <u>Data Validation Panel</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Batch Editor also includes a Data Validation panel at the bottom-left of the Workspace.
      Fields containing invalid data are highlighted in red and fields containing edited data are
      highlighted in green. The panel also displays a total count of affected fields.
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Changes made in the Batch Editor can not be applied when
      invalid data is present.
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Not all fields are available for editing in the Batch
      Editor. Non-editable fields are grayed out.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       If at any time during editing you wish to revert back to the original data, click the
      <em>Undo All</em> button located at the bottom-right of the Workspace screen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have finished editing your data and are ready to commit your changes, click the
      <em>Apply</em> button located at the bottom-right of the Workspace screen.

    <p>
       <u>Validate and Apply&nbsp;Your Edits</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Specify will now validate your data, and display statistics about the changes you are about
      to make. At this point your changes have not been&nbsp;committed to the database, and you can
      click the <em>Cancel</em> button without losing your edits.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Batch Progress dialog will display both alerts regarding the&nbsp;progress in validating
      the edits&nbsp;and results of the changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applying your edits is a progress statement
      </li>
      <li>
        Validating changes to the database is a progress statement
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of edits successfully applied and validated
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Typically this will display that All edits were successfully applied; however, if a
        concurrent user edited one of the records while you were batch editing, Specify will
        recognize this and skip those records. If you wish to verify this with a co-worker you can
        click the <em>Cancel</em> button at the bottom of the dialog to cancel the process. The
        Batch Editor will still be displayed with all your previous changes and you can apply the
        changes again when you are ready.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Number of Collection Objects affected by your changes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         This message displays the total number of records that will be updated in each table that
        is affected by the batch edit. It is meant to help you understand the relationships
        to&nbsp;tables that are affected by your changes. If these numbers do not reflect the
        changes you believe you made we recommend that you cancel the update at this time. It may
        be useful&nbsp;to select only a few records to load into the batch editor, make your edits,
        and then apply them in the batch editor. Once that is complete you can create queries on
        those changed records that allow you to better understand how the edits you made have
        affected related fields and tables, and whether you wish to proceed in making those changes
        to all your records.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether your changes were saved or canceled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       A timer also appears on the Batch Process dialog, allowing you 3 minutes to either commit or
      cancel your changes. When you bring data into the batch editor, you are essentially 'checking
      it out' from the database so that you may make changes that will later be validated and
      applied. If other users are also accessing and editing the same data, it can result in&nbsp;a
      different version of data in the database than when the data was originally checked out. In
      this instance Specify will not commit the change and will alert you to this action in the
      status dialog. Once the validation process has completed, Specify will not check the version
      of the data again. For that reason, we limit the amount of time between the validation
      completion and the choice to either commit or cancel the updates.

    <p>
       <u>Batch Edited Record Sets</u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Upon completion of a Batch Edit the records are saved in a new Record Set. If you saved the
      original query used to define the data you edited, then the resulting record set will use the
      same name as the query. If you did not save the query the record set will be saved
      wtih&nbsp;the name of the table used to create the query followed by a number that increments
      by 1 each time that the query was used for a batch edit. For example, if you created a
      Collecting Event query but did not save it, the ensuing record set would be named: New
      Collecting Event Query 1. You do not need to save these Record Sets, they are only meant to
      give you an opportunity to see the edited records at a later time. You may find it convenient
      to rename the record sets with the name or objective of the Batch or perhaps the date.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        View the records in the Record Set in Specify data forms by clicking on the record set name
        in the sidebar.
      </li>
      <li>
        View the records in the Record Set in a spreadsheet format by right-mouse clicking the
        Record Set name&nbsp;in the side bar and choosing <em>View with saved Query</em> in the
        pop-up dialog.
